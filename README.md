# Fractal Symbols: Board Game Library

As its name suggests, the symbols in this library are for board games. The symbols can be used for prototypes or even finished products as is, or be adapted to suit the product’s need.

I started making and collecting these symbols because I had difficulty finding usable vector symbols that I needed for my board game prototypes. Making and collecting the symbols became a whole separate project and eventually, I was making symbols for potential prototypes rather than existing ones.

Finally, my collection had grown enough to share with other board game designers (and everyone else), so that others may use what I have created, and, like me, can spend more time designing and making the games rather than the symbols.

## Technical information
All files (sections) are in .eps vector format with CMYK color-setting. Symbols are aligned in a grid of 7 columns and as many rows as needed. They are colored black with no outline and are sized to fit inside a 100x100mm square (unless otherwise needed for the symbol). To use them you need a vector-based illustration program like Illustrator or Inkscape. Each section is showcased below with its title, a sample of symbols, and a rough description of what’s in that section.
